# Question 5
# Design a function that takes a list of integers as input.
# The function should return True if the list contains two consecutive threes (3 next to a 3)
# anywhere within the list.
# Otherwise, it should return False.
# For example, the function should return True for [1,3,3] and False for [1,3,1,3].

def consecutive_threes(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] == 3 and lst[i + 1] == 3:
            return True
    return False


print(consecutive_threes([1, 3, 3]))
print(consecutive_threes([1, 3, 1, 3]))
